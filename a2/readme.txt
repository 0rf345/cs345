	make all		-> 	creates GoL executable
	make clean		->	removes GoL executable
./GoL < valid_input_file 	->	gets the Game of Life started
	ctr+c			->	stops the program from running, gracefully

	Each iteration is printed on the screen with a couple of clean lines in 
	between generations. Also clear is run every iteration as to keep the
	printout as clean as possible.
